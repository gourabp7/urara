<p style="text-align:center;">Main Building at IISc, Bangalore</p>

Hi, my name’s Gourab and I’m a PhD Student working under supervision of [Prof. Phani Motamarri](https://sites.google.com/view/matrix-lab/bio-of-the-pi) at [MATRIX Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/matrix-lab), [Department of Computational and Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in), [Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in). My research focuses on developing hardware-aware computational algorithms and novel implementation techniques to accelerate large-scale iterative eigenvalue and linear solvers on heterogenous architectures. This includes developing matrix-free methods, mixed-precision strategies, compressed basis techniques and communication avoidance algorithms. These procedures can be applied to accelerate solvers employed in various fields, in particular, the quantum modeling of materials which are solved on extreme-scaling computing architectures using finite element discretization of Kohn-Sham density functional theory equations.

**_(Winner of the [2023 ACM Gordon Bell Prize](https://www.acm.org/media-center/2023/november/gordon-bell-prize-2023), the highest prize in High Performance Computing)_**

DFT-FE (C++/CUDA/MPI) is a massively parallel finite-element based open-source code for material modeling using density functional theory (DFT). DFT-FE can handle periodic, non-periodic and semi-periodic calculations. It can further handle both pseudopotential (ONCV, Troullier-Martins) and all-electron (non-relativistic) calculations; XC functionals supported are LDA, GGA (including spin-polarized); Capabilities include ground-state calculations, structural relaxations (ionic, cell), ab-initio MD (NVE). Scalability tested on ~200,000 MPI tasks on many-core architectures and ~64,000 GPUs on hybrid CPU-GPU architectures.

**_Project Associate_** (2020-2021) <br>
